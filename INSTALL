Build and Installation of Libdiscid
===================================

You can either use the autotools to build libdiscid or,
on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, SunOS and Cygwin,
you can also use Cmake.


Cmake
-----

    cmake .
    make
    make install

test with:

    ./test_discid



Autotools
---------

    ./configure
    make
    make install

test with:

    make check


Tips for Windows
----------------

For most systems cmake and autotools work (nearly) "out of the box".
On Windows the build was tested using MinGW and running in the MinGW shell:

    cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles"
    make

You can also create Visual Studio project files.
Just type "cmake" to see a list of options.
